        Parameters:
            debug: Boolean indicating if debug tracebacks should be returned on errors.
            routes: A list of routes to serve incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests.
            middleware: A list of middleware to run for every request. A starlette
                application will always automatically include two middleware classes.
                `ServerErrorMiddleware` is added as the very outermost middleware, to handle
                any uncaught errors occurring anywhere in the entire stack.
                `ExceptionMiddleware` is added as the very innermost middleware, to deal
                with handled exception cases occurring in the routing or endpoints.
            exception_handlers: A mapping of either integer status codes,
                or exception class types onto callables which handle the exceptions.
                Exception handler callables should be of the form
                `handler(request, exc) -> response` and may be either standard functions, or
                async functions.
            lifespan: A lifespan context function, which can be used to perform
                startup and shutdown tasks. This is a newer style that replaces the
                `on_startup` and `on_shutdown` handlers. Use one or the other, not both.
            max_body_size: Non-negative maximum total size in bytes of an HTTP request
                body. The default, `None`, does not limit request body size.
